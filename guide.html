    <h3>The Code</h3>
    <h4 id="scratch">Making a website from scratch</h4>
    <p>
        Making the perfect CSP website isn't hard. First you need to make a <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>
        account. If you want to start from scratch, you need to make a git repository:<br> <img class="repo-pic"
            src="/pics/repo-pic.png" alt="" width="50%"><br>
        When making the Repository make sure that the Repository name is username.github.io, username being your
        username. Make sure that you make the repository public, add a readme, and choose a License(most people choose
        MIT License), and create the repository.<br>
        You should see something like this.<br>
        <img src="/pics/add_page_pic.png" alt="Add Github Files"><br>
        Click Add File and click on create new file, to create new files. Name the files index.html, about.html and
        portfolio.html. These should be the files for the home page, the about me page and the portfolio page.<br>
    </p>
    <h5>Writing HTML:</h5>
    <p>Before you start writing HTML, you should get a text editor. I would suggest Atom, since that is pretty beginner
        friendly.
        <a href="http://page">Here</a> is some sample html you can use to start your website. If you want to learn some
        of
        the tags used for html and css go check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a>. This guide
        should
        be more for uploading your code to github and Mr.Dunlea's requirements for the website.
    </p>
    <h4 id="template">Starting with a template</h4>
    <p>
        You can use my code as a template, as long as you tailor certain things towards your needs. Is it cheating?
        Err.. kinda, but its not cheating if you learn how the code works, and how you can personalize it. I have laid
        down some of the groundwork for you, but you will still be doing the important stuff on your own.<br>
        Obviously make a github account before you start. Then, go <a href="">here</a>, and click on the Code button
        <img src="/pics/code_down.png" alt="Download Code"><br> <br>
        Before you start writing HTML, you should get a text editor. I would suggest Atom, since that is pretty beginner
        friendly. Download the code to a folder in your computer, and open Atom inside that folder. Start by removing
        the guide.html file as well as the guide.css file inside the css folder. Then start editing HTML and CSS for
        each file according to your needs. You can look at the website <a href="">here</a> to see which part of the code
        refers to which part of the website.
    </p>

    <h4 id="#deploying">Deploying Code</h4>
    <p>
        You can use Github Desktop to upload your deploy your code, but it may be a bit more complicated for you. Here
        is a
        slightly easier way, that will work for a basic website. Open the link to the repository, and then go to the
        folder
        where you have the files for the website:
        and select all the files: CTRL/COMMAND + A. Now drag the files over to the browser like this:<br>
        <img src="/pics/uploading_files.gif" alt="Uploading Files" width="30%"><br>
        After that click on commit changes to upload those changes to your website. Do this every time you change
        something on your website. Now, you need to make your website live. Open your website repository in your
        browser, and go to settings, and find Github Pages in your in the settings. Then click on none and then master
        and then save
        like this: <img src="/pics/github_pages.gif" alt="Github Pages" width="30%"><br>
        Give it a minute or so and your website should be live @ username.github.io.
    </p>
    <h4 id="requirements">Mr.Dunlea's requirements</h4>
    <p>You need:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>An index.html, a portfolio.html, and an about.html. You can add more pages but those are required.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>index.html: It needs at least on picture, preferably of a home. Music makes things better.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>about.html: It needs a couple of pictures and stuff about you, you know.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>portfolio.html: It should be centered, and have a picture of each project you do. You should also add
                a
                short description as well.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h4 id="tags">Things to learn</h4>
    <p>There are some important tags that you should know to easily edit html: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_html.asp">html</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_head.asp">head</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_body.asp">body</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp">div</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp">h1-h6</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_p.asp">p</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp">a</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">img</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_iframe.asp">iframe</a></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This looks like a lot of work to go over these, but these are pretty simple tags.
